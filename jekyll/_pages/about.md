I work in WINGS Lab under the guidance of Prof. Samir R. Das. My research interests are Systems and Networking. I try to (significantly) improve these systems using data-driven techniques.

I am interning at AT&T Labs, Bedminister, NJ in summer 2018.

More details can be found in my <a href="assets/docs/CV.pdf">CV</a>
